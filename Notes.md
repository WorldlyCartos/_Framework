# Domain modeling vs Pydantic modeling
Domain Models (in app/domain)
Purpose:
Represent the core business entities (like Stand, StandPart, StandAttributes) with their associated behavior and business logic.
Characteristics:
Framework-agnostic: They shouldn’t be coupled with FastAPI or Pydantic, which makes them easier to test and evolve.
Implementation: You can implement these as plain Python classes, dataclasses, or even use Pydantic if you want validation inside your domain (though many prefer keeping them separate).
Pydantic Models (in app/schemas)
Purpose:
Act as the data validation and serialization layer between the API and your application. They ensure that data coming into your endpoints is properly validated and that responses are formatted correctly.
Characteristics:
Request/Response Handling: When an API endpoint receives a request, FastAPI automatically validates it against a Pydantic model. Similarly, you can use a Pydantic model as the response model.
Documentation: Pydantic models automatically generate part of your OpenAPI docs, describing the shape of the data.
How They Work Together
Incoming Request:
A client sends data to your API.
FastAPI uses a Pydantic model (defined in, say, app/schemas/stands.py) to validate and parse that data.
Conversion to Domain Model:
Once validated, you convert the Pydantic model (or its data) into your domain model (defined in app/domain/models.py). This domain model is used within your business logic.
Processing & Business Logic:
Your domain model might include methods to enforce business rules, perform calculations, or interact with other domain entities.
Preparing a Response:
After processing, you can convert the domain model back into a Pydantic model (or a simplified dict) that FastAPI will serialize as JSON for the response.
Getting Started
Step 1: Define a Simple Domain Model
In app/domain/models.py, outline the key properties and methods for your core entity (e.g., Stand). This is where you capture the essence of what a "stand" is in your business.

Step 2: Define Pydantic Schemas
In app/schemas/stands.py, create Pydantic models that mirror the data your API should accept and return.

For example, create a base schema for a stand, a schema for creating a new stand, and a schema for returning stand details.
Step 3: Connect in the API Layer
In your API endpoint (e.g., in app/api/endpoints/stands.py), use the Pydantic models as request and response models. When you receive valid data, convert it into a domain model instance for further processing. When sending a response, convert your domain model back into a Pydantic schema.

Where to Start?
If you’re unsure where to begin, you might:

Sketch Out Your Core Entity:
Identify the main fields and behaviors for your Stand. What attributes does it have (e.g., stand_oid, geometry), and what operations are performed on it?
Define a Pydantic Model for API Use:
Create a basic Pydantic model for a stand. Once that’s working with your endpoints, start thinking about how to create a more robust domain model that encapsulates the business logic.
Iterate:
As you refine your understanding of the business domain, you can evolve your domain models and add additional Pydantic models as needed.
Summary
Domain Models: Focus on business logic and stay independent of FastAPI specifics.
Pydantic Models: Handle data validation and serialization for API interactions.
Workflow: Validate API data with Pydantic → Convert to a domain model → Process business logic → Convert back for API responses.
This separation allows you to keep your core business logic clean while leveraging FastAPI’s automatic validation and documentation through Pydantic.
